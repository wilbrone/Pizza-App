## Description
This app allows our users and visitors to order pizza as they decide which toppings they preffer and crust type for their pizzas. they get to decide whether they want small or large. Users get to see their total bill at the end of every order made. The app also prompts users whether they would like their pizza delivered at their door steps.

## Technologies Used
the system uses JQuery, Html and Java Script

## BDD
The app allows the user to choose several toppings, one crust and sizes they prefer. Using this data or input I get the price of the toppings, crust and size of each and every pizza. We have delivery services which have a constant fee of 200 shillings. I use this data I get to calculate the total amount the user will be needed to pay. the price may range for one who requires a delivery.
